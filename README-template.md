## My process

As I am new to building repsonsive websites, I started off with the mobile version (this appeared to be the recommended method), followed by the required adaptations for the desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a usefull exercise to strengthen my understanding of responsive design. It also allowed me to further develop / refresh my knowledge of CSS design (e.g. the use of shadow).

### Continued development

Looking forward to continue to strenghten my understanding of responsive websites on top of costantly improving the accessibility of my pages.
